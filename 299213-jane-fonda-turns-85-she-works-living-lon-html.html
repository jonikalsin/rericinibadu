She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/jane-fonda-cancer-battle-wants-to-see-grandkids-grow/>mentioned</a> how proud she was to have lived a "productive and intentional life," adding:</p><p class=dh>“I thank all of you who prayed and sent good thoughts my way. I am confident that it played a role in the good news.”</p><p class=dh>The star was also lucky to be close to her three children and two grandchildren, had friends, and had great relationships with some of her exes. A friend said Fonda grew up with a privileged life and didn't complain.</p><p class=dh>The actress was allegedly thankful for the ups and downs she'd experienced in life and wasn't afraid of dying. However, she did explain that she wasn't ready to go but was aware that it would happen soon enough.</p><p class=dh>Reaching 85 wasn't easy, requiring the actress to take extra care of herself.

The "Grace and Frankie" actress said she slept eight or nine hours each night.</p><p class=dh>The star shared how she meditated in nature as much as possible because the surrounding brought her joy. Fonda also exercised as she'd <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.glamour.com/story/jane-fonda-cover-story>realized</a> as she got older that staying healthy was a "joyful and critical" practice.</p><p class=dh>The "Book Club" actress <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.glamour.com/story/jane-fonda-cover-story>explained</a> how it had taken her a while to realize one's body was "very forgiving" when one was young. The star said she'd abused her body back then but being older now, when she drank too much for one night or didn't sleep sufficiently, she weren't fully functional the next day.</p><p class=dh>Fonda didn't like the feeling, which was motivation enough for her to take better care of herself. Despite her age, the actress remained curious by asking people questions and reading many books.</p><p class=dh>She felt staying curious as an older person also helped you remain young for a long time.

The star was a grandparent who doted on her grandchildren, whom she wished to see their futures.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>What Kind of Grandmother Is Fonda?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In 2022, Fonda had two grandchildren, Malcolm Vadim, 23, in 2022, and Viva Vadim, 20.
