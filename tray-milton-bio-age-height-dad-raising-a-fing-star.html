The brother-sister duo is appearing on E! show with their mother Kia Brooks on the show Raising a F***ing Star. We know by now that they are half-siblings who share the same mother. But, what about Tray’s father, and who is he? What is Tray’s job?</p><p>This Tray Milton Bio helps you explore all the details. So delve in to learn more about him.</p><h3><strong>Tray Milton On Raising a F***ing Star</strong></h3><p>E! premiered a new show titled Raising a F***ing Star. The show followed four families searching for fame through their kids and believing that they got what it takes to be the next household name. The show adopted its theme from the 2004 series Showbiz Moms & Dads.</p><p>Tray Milton, is one of the family members appearing on the E!’s show. To be more precise, he is a member of the Brooks family. His sister is Flau’Jae Johnson, who aspires to be a star, and their mom is Kia Brooks, the momager of his sister. Flau’jae already has an upper hand because her father Jason “Camoflauge” Johnson was a well-established rapper from the 1990s and early 200s.</p><p>The rapper sadly passed away in 2003 and now Tray’s sister believes that she is the one that her father handed the torch and she is ready to run with it. But, Tray doesn’t feel the same because he feels that his mother is prioritizing his sister more over him. He thinks that she is pulling a Kris Jenner on him, as he also wants to be a musician.</p><p>So, we can certainly expect some sibling rivalry between the two based on that.</p><h3><strong>Tray Milton Dad</strong></h3><p>Trayron Lennoris Milton Jr. Was born to his dad Trayron Milton Sr.</p><p>Born in April 1981, Tray Milton Sr is currently 41 years old. The father-son duo doesn’t seem to share a very pleasant relationship. Instead, he is close to his stepdad Ameen Brooks.</p><p>In May 2019, on Ameen’s birthday, he dedicated a post to his stepdad on his Facebook. He wished him saying, “I just wanna take the time to say thank you for being one of the most God-fearing, family-oriented, respectful, compassionate, nurturing, vigilant, and remarkable human beings I’ve ever met in my entire life. Your ability to light up a room with just your presence alone is undoubtedly one of your most amazing qualities. After being hurt so many times in my life by individuals, you are the closest thing to an actual father figure that I’ve ever had.”</p><p>He concluded, “You’re patient with my mother, sister, brother, and all the baggage we come with. So for that, I will forever be grateful for God taking the time to put you in my life. I wish I could be there with you on your special day but you know I’m locking these grades down so I can pay you and Kia back for everything y’all have done for me. Happy Birthday”</p><p>A year before that on Ameen’s 36th birthday, Tray described his stepdad as “the most ambitious man” he knows.</p><p>On Father’s Day 2014, Tray wrote on Facebook, “But On A Real Note… Happy Father’s Day To My Mother! <a class="qi72231t nu7423ey n3hqoq4p r86q59rh b3qcqh3k fq87ekyn bdao358l fsf7x5fv rse6dlih s5oniofx m8h3af8h l7ghb35v kjdc1dyq kmwttqpk srn514ro oxkhqvkx rl78xhln nch0832m cr00lzj9 rn8ck1ys s3jn8y49 icdlwmnq cxfqmxzd d1w2l3lo tes86rjd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#><span class=rse6dlih>Lakia Jones</span></a> Strongest Person I Know!”</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Tray Milton?</strong></h3><p>1999 marked the year Tray Milton was born.

The young artist hopes to build his career and become an established artist, like the pop stars that inspire him.</p><p>Tray has also experimented in every aspect of entertainment. This prodigy, now age 21, has experience in the industry thanks to her modeling in New York Fashion Week, being noticed in a few movies, and traveling with Mindless Behavior and OMG Girlz as a backup dancer when she was only 14 years old.
