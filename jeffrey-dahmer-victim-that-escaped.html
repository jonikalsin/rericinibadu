Two men who have spoken out in interviews to admit that Dahmer sexually assaulted them now describe the murderer as a sociopath. Jeffrey Dahmer approached Tracy along with his two friends in his flat for a sleazy photo shoot. However, he managed to escape and inform the police. </strong><strong style=color:#252525>As per his wiki, Tracy has reportedly been homeless since 2002, but he made headlines once more in 2011 after he and Timothy Carr threw Jonny Jordan, another homeless guy, down a bridge following an argument. </strong><strong style=color:#252525>As viewers wonder about Tracy’s obituary, there is no such information, and it seems that as of 2022, he is still alive.</strong></p><p>It takes <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Dahmer Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story</a></strong> six episodes on <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Netflix</a></strong> to significantly go beyond the confines of the serial killer and <strong>Evan Peters</strong>‘ portrayal of him. The story of Dahmer victim <strong>Tony Anthony Hughes</strong> is highlighted in that episode, Silenced, which was directed by <strong>Paris Barclay</strong> and written by <strong>Janet Mock</strong> and <strong>David McMillan</strong>. Tony was a jovial, aspiring model with a large heart. But as the show’s absurdly confusing title suggests, this episode stands out more than most.</p><p>One of history’s most notorious <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>killers</a></strong>, Jeffrey Dahmer, is still at large. Dahmer lured gay teenagers into his flat, where he assaulted, killed, and dismembered them.&nbsp;<strong>Konerak Sinthasomphone</strong>, a 14-year-old child, managed to escape from his grasp, but his success did not result in <strong>Jeffrey Dahmer’s</strong> being imprisoned. However, there was another victim <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Tracy Edwards</a></strong> that managed to escape.

As per his wiki, on July 22, 1991, Jeffrey Dahmer went out looking for victims when he stumbled upon Tracy Edwards, 32, and two of his friends.</p><p>Jeffrey <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>introduced</a></strong> himself as a photographer and asked if anyone would like to go with him to his flat for a sleazy photo shoot. The men were about to decline Jeffrey’s offer because they had never met him before and were pretty hesitant about it when Tracy Edwards gave his approval.</p><p>As per the <a href=# rel=noopener>story</a>, while the rest went their separate ways, Jeffrey escorted Tracy up to his flat. Tracy entered the flat and immediately became quite wary due to the foul smell. In addition, he saw bottles of hydrochloric acid laying around and a blue drum emitting an offensive odor in another room.</p><p>He wasn’t even able to get his bearings before Jeffrey diverted his attention by putting a handcuff on his wrist and saying it was a prop for the photo shoot. After taking the intended victim to a second room, where he told Tracy that he meant to devour his heart, the serial killer’s actions changed. In the years that followed, Tracy was unable to avoid a life of crime due to his ongoing legal troubles. When an opening presented itself, Tracy smacked Jeffrey in the face before fleeing through the front door.</p><p>As per Netflix’s <a href=# rel=noopener>show</a>,&nbsp;Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, Eventually, he persuaded Jeffrey to return to the first room. Outside the flat, Tracy encountered two policemen, who at first didn’t believe his account due to the handcuffs around his wrist.</p><p>However, he persuaded them to accompany him to Jeffrey’s <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>apartment</a></strong> where they found Polaroid pictures of victims who had been severed from their bodies along with human body parts, including an entire skull that was preserved inside a refrigerator.</p><p>Following the arrest of Jeffrey Dahmer, Tracy decided to file a case against the Milwaukee court because he felt that by not treating the earlier accusations against Jeffrey seriously, the Milwaukee court had failed in its obligation to protect the public. Even though Jeffrey made every effort to fight the police and get away, he was eventually outmatched and taken away in handcuffs.</p><p>Following the arrest of Jeffrey Dahmer, Tracy decided to file a case against the Milwaukee court because he felt that by not treating the earlier accusations against Jeffrey seriously, the Milwaukee court had failed in its obligation to protect the public. After eventually getting the lawsuit dismissed, Tracy was able to resume his routine.</p><p>As shown in the <a href=# rel=noopener>series</a>, Unexpectedly, Tracy maintained his composure the entire time and started putting together a strategy to leave while assuring Jeffrey of his friendship. Sources said, he racked up a sizable criminal record and was imprisoned for offenses like drug possession and theft. Tracy, who has been homeless since 2002, gained new notoriety in 2011 when he and <strong>Timothy Carr</strong> violently tossed another homeless man, <strong>Jonny Jordan</strong>, from a bridge after arguing.</p><p>Sadly, Jonny drowned to death the same year, and Tracy received a total prison term of one and a half years for his involvement. Unfortunately, Tracy has decided to maintain his anonymity since then, making it difficult to pinpoint his current location.</p><p>Two men who have spoken out in interviews to admit that Dahmer sexually assaulted them while he was in the military are now describing the murderer as a sociopath.
