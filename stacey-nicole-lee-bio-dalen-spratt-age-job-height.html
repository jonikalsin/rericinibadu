The two instantly fell in love with each other and knew he/she was “the one.”</span></p><p><span>According to Stacey, “I knew I found the one in Dalen because I didn’t just love him, I wasn’t just attracted to him, I liked him as a person.”&nbsp; Although being lovebirds, the duo would laugh and talk as friends, and share about everything.&nbsp; “I love his love for his family and especially how he treats and loves on his mother. He is my homey, lover, and friend,” she added.</span></p><p><span>As for Dalen, he first knew she was “the one” when he took a job delivering groceries to make some extra cash after her television show wasn’t renewed at the time. “She never once made me feel any type of way and thoroughly supported my decision.
