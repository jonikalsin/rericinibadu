She maintains her sophisticated status on the Atlanta social scene by making time for her daily fitness regimen. Moreover, Whitfield juggles her hectic schedule, fashion line, and family life with her three children, <strong>Kairo, Kaleigh, </strong>and<strong> Tierra,</strong> with ease.</p><p>Sheree has been a cast member on The Real Housewives of Atlanta since the show’s inception in 2008. She was a regular cast member on the show for four seasons before leaving. However, she returned to the show four years later as a friend for season 8, was promoted to a full-time position for two years, seasons 9 & 10, and then left for the second time. Similarly, her other ventures include her fashion line SHE by Sherée, which failed to take off while she was on the show. In 2018, she debuted her Spring/Summer Athleisure Fashion Line.</p><p>Tyrone Gilliams’ absence from a meeting in Philadelphia during this season of The Real Housewives of Atlanta dashed Sheree Whitfield’s hopes for a happily ever after following their split. Sheree, on the other hand, is still looking for her happily ever after, and it appears that she has found a new boyfriend in 2022. Continue reading to learn more about her new boyfriend.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>relationship status</a></strong> of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Karrueche Tran</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Matt Smith</a></strong>.</p><h2>Sheree Whitfield’s New Boyfriend 2022: Meet Love & Marriage Huntsville Star Martell Holt!</h2><p><strong>Sheree</strong> <strong>Whitfield,</strong> a Real Housewives of Atlanta star, is <a href=# rel=noopener>dating</a> her new boyfriend <strong>Martell Holt </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@martellholt</a>) in 2022. The reality stars have reportedly been dating for more than two months. She met Holt through a mutual friend, and she has since introduced him to several of her friends and family members. The couple was seen taking selfies at the beach a few days ago.</p><p>On July 17, 2022, during Sheree’s appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, he asked the Atlanta Housewife about her love life. Sheree then <a href=# rel=noopener>revealed</a> that she had met someone new and that she is really enjoying getting to know someone in particular, before confirming to <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> that his name does not begin with a T and thus is not<strong> Tyrone.</strong></p><p>Her new boyfriend, Martell has been on Love & Marriage: Huntsville since its first season in 2018. Martell Holt is a reality television celebrity, businessman, author, and television host from the United States.

He later resigned in December 2010 to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions.</p><p>And, unfortunately, a quick look into his past reveals that he does not have the best reputation. While he was married to <strong>Arionne Curry,</strong> he had a long-term affair with another woman. Additionally, Martell has four children from a previous marriage. Martell Holt, on the other hand, is the father of five children. He has four children with ex-wife <strong>Melody Holt:</strong> <strong>Maliah, Mariah, Martell, </strong>and<strong> Malani,</strong> as well as a son with <strong>Arionne Curry.</strong></p><p>However, the current relationship between Sheree Whitfield and Love & Marriage: Huntsville actor Martell Holt is not universally popular. <strong>Kandi Burruss,</strong> Sheree’s Real Housewives of Atlanta co-star has openly expressed her concerns about the couple’s relationship just days after it was publicly announced.</p><h2>Complete Detail on Sheree Whitfield’s Ex-boyfriend/Husband!</h2><p><strong>Sheree Whitfield</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@shereewhitfield</a>) was previously married to NFL player <strong>Bob Whitfield</strong> from 2002 to 2007. The former couple welcomed son <strong>Kairo</strong> and daughter <strong>Kaleigh</strong> in 1996 and 1999, respectively, joining Sheree’s previous relationship’s daughter <strong>Tierra.&nbsp;</strong>Before Martell, she previously dated <strong>Tyrone Gilliams,</strong> whose breakup was depicted on Season 14 of Real Housewives of Atlanta.</p><p>Whitfield and Gilliams, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to sources</a>, were hanging out together in his hometown of Philadelphia since his release in 2021. Sheree Whitfield, a former reality star&nbsp;was reunited with her boyfriend, Tyrone Gilliams, who was released from prison early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gilliams was sentenced to ten years in prison for wire fraud in 2013. He and Whitfield had dated prior to his arrest.</p><p>Whitfield visited him in a Kentucky prison on a regular basis after the couple reconnected in 2016. Moreover, she claimed the two communicated via love letters. Sheree spoke more about her ex on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, saying she hasn’t heard from him since the episode where he didn’t show up in Philadelphia in an earlier season of RHOA.</p><p>In 2013, Sheere’s ex-boyfriend, Gilliams, was sentenced to ten years in prison for wire fraud. Whitfield visited him in a Kentucky prison on a regular basis after the couple reconnected in 2016. He and his attorney were convicted of stealing more than <strong>$5 million</strong> from their investors. He had previously presented himself as a commodities trader, hip-hop promoter, and aspiring philanthropist. He attempted to improve his image by organizing a large charity event that featured several celebrities.</p><p>According to federal prosecutors, Gilliams and <strong>Everette Scott</strong> used their investors’ money for personal gain, spending it on luxury cars, jewelry, and travel. Scott received a 30-month prison sentence for his role in the scheme. Gilliams arrived at his 2013 sentencing with more than two dozen supporters, including his father, a minister in Philadelphia.
